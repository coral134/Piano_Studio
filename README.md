# Piano Studio
This project is currently under development!

### Description
Piano Studio is an Android app that will let you connect your digital piano to your Android device and play, record, and learn music. The app will use the MIDI protocol to send and receive data from your digital piano, allowing the app to record the keys you press and play them back at a later time. The user will be able to import, edit, and export MIDI files, with an emphasis on tools for music composition and practice. The app will assist with music practice by visually showing the next keys to be pressed and progressing at the userâ€™s own pace. Any song can be practiced using the app, as long as the user provides the piece in MIDI format.

### Current Progress
Currently, the app can connect to a digital keyboard, display the notes being pressed, and record a song for later playback. The recording mode is close to complete, but does not yet save recordings permanently or export them as MIDI files.
